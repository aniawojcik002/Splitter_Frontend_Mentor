## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size 
Two main view: mobile and desktop - From my point of view should be one more view for medium devices (thing to develop in the future)
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page 
- Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person (This is simple app so calculation for big numbers are not adequate... think to develop in the future)
